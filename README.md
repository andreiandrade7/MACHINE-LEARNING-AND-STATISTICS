## =============================== PROJECT =====================================


### Overview:

This repository contains code and notebooks related to a Machine Learning and Statistics project focusing on the analysis of the Iris dataset using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.


### Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to explore and demonstrate the application of the KNN algorithm in classifying different iris species based on various features.

### Contents
- Reset Workspace: Cautionary command to reset the workspace, clearing prior definitions.

- Python Libraries: Importing necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

- Part 1 - Machine Learning:
    Explanation of supervised vs. unsupervised learning.
    Overview of classification and regression in supervised learning.
    Introduction to the scikit-learn library and its applications.
    Brief Dataset Description: Summary of the Iris dataset, including attribute information and statistical details.

-Part 2 - Classification Algorithm: Detailed explanation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and its implementation on the Iris dataset.
    Data Set Preparation:
    Cleaning empty lines and handling missing values.
    Data normalization using StandardScaler.
    Splitting the Data: Methods for dividing the dataset into training and test subsets.
    Mathematical Notation: Deconstructing the KNN algorithm using mathematical formulas.
    Classifier Scoring Metrics: Explanation and calculation of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Plotting Decision Boundaries: Visualization of decision boundaries for different feature combinations.
    Confusion Matrix Mapping: Generation and plotting of the confusion matrix to visualize classification performance.


### Run the Code:
To clone and run the code or notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using git clone
Navigate to the cloned directory.
Install the required Python libraries 
Run the provided code or notebooks using Python or preferred IDE.
Execute the code cells in the notebooks or run the Python scripts to reproduce the analyses and visualizations.


### Conclusion
The README file demonstrates that the KNN classifier, particularly with k=9, performs outstandingly well on the Iris dataset, accurately classifying all iris flowers into their respective categories without making any mistakes. This comprehensive evaluation through visualizations, scoring metrics, and the confusion matrix helps in understanding and validating the model's effectiveness in classifying iris flowers


### Additional Notes:

The code comments and markdown sections offer comprehensive explanations for each step of the analysis.
All the generated plots and tables are stored in the "images" folder within the current directory.
The datasets utilized for both the project and tasks are saved in the "data" folder within the same directory.
